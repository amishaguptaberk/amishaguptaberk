  <h2>About Me </h2>

  <p> Hi there! I'm <strong>Amisha Gupta 🌟</strong>, currently a rising junior at <strong>UC Berkeley 🎓</strong>, passionate about leveraging <strong>AI in healthcare 🏥</strong> to transform patient outcomes. I'm skilled in <strong>Data Science 📊</strong> and <strong>Computer Science 💻.</strong></p>

  <h3>My Journey in a Nutshell </h3>

  <p>From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology's power to solve real-world problems. This curiosity led me to UC Berkeley, where I'm pursuing a double major in Data Science and Computer Science. Here, I've gained valuable experience through:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Explore Neurotechnology Research (Project Link, if applicable):</strong> Using AI to understand and treat neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease, focusing on enhancing clinical decision support systems (ML_CDSS) 🧠.</li>
    <li><strong>Investigate Non-Pharmaceutical Treatments (Project Link, if applicable):</strong> Explored the impact of music therapy and environmental factors on Alzheimer's disease at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology 🎶🌍.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I've Been Up To </h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>IMDEA Networks Institute (Research Internship):</strong> Currently working on providing cloud-like services in remote areas with unreliable network connectivity ⛅. This project focuses on improving network reliability and accessibility.</li>
    <li><strong>UC Berkeley (Modules Developer & Course Staff):</strong> Designed curriculum and taught students how to apply computational and statistical skills in biology using Python and other data visualization libraries .</li>
    <li><strong>Stanford University (Research Assistant):</strong> Researched the biopsychological aspects of Alzheimer's disease, contributing to our understanding of beta-amyloid plaques' impact 🧬.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Beyond the Lab ✈️</h3>

  <p>When I'm not immersed in research or coursework, you can find me indulging in some of my favorite hobbies:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Music 🎵</strong>: I have a deep love for vocal performance and have won multiple competitions, including the CSMTA Concerto Competition and the NATS Regional Auditions.</li>
    <li> <strong>Travel ✈️🌍</strong>: Exploring new places and cultures is my way of gaining new perspectives. My research has taken me to fascinating destinations like Spain and China.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading 📚</strong>: Staying updated with the latest in scientific literature is a hobby that keeps my curiosity alive and kicking.</li>
    <li><strong>Fitness 🧘‍♂️🏃‍♀️</strong>: Yoga and running are my go-to activities for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Publications & Honors 🏅</h3>

  <p>I've had the privilege of contributing to the scientific community through publications like "The Relevance of Chemistry in Tumor Microenvironment of Cancer Patients" and "Effect on Alzheimer's Disease During COVID-19." My academic journey has also been decorated with honors such as the National Latin Vocabulary Exam Gold Medal and multiple first-place wins in vocal competitions.</p>
